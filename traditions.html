            <h3><b>Danish Traditions</b></h3>
            <p>Denmark's traditions draw inspiration from many places. They are influenced by Christianity, pagan beliefs and other historical events.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Holidays</h3>
            <p>Like the rest of the Nordic countries, Denmark celebrates Christmas on the 24th of December. There are some regional differences however. In Denmark, duck is traditionally part of the Christmas dinner. Also on the table is Risalamalde, a porridge made with rice and cream. It is usually enjoyed with cherry-jam and almonds.

            <p>Another annual holiday is Fastelavn. Much like Halloween, kids will dress up and go house to house hoping to earn candy. It is usually accompanied by an event, in which a barrel filled with candy is smashed. Historically the barrel contained a cat, giving this practice the name “cat barrel”. The person to break the barrel would be crowned “cat king” or “cat queen”.

            <h3>Placeholder</h3>
            <p>In Denmark, being unmarried means you get a little special treatment, just not the good kind. It is tradition to cover those still single in cinnamon, and water to make it stick. Then at thirty, if your marital status has remained unchanged, the cinnamon is replaced with pepper. The practice may have originated from spice-sellers back in the day. They would travel too much to find someone to settle down with, and be dubbed Pebersvends or “pepper dudes”.
