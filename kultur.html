            <h3><b>Denmark's Cultural demographics.</b></h3>
            <p>When visiting Denmark it may be convenient to speak at least one Nordic language. But it isn’t necessary, ca 86% of Danes also speak english as a second language. Denmark is also heavily secularised with only a small minority of Danes considering religion to be important.</p>

            <h3><b>Danish food for tourists.</b></h3>
            <p>Denmark has quite the food culture. When visiting Copenhagen You may find yourself buying ice cream with “guf” , a fluffy mix of sugar and egg. I would recommend you also go to the local supermarket and buy “Fiskefrikadeller” , the Danish equivalent of Swedish meatballs. They make a really good meal if you have a way of heating them and don’t want to eat at a restaurant. Lastly, don't forget to visit a local bakery and get lots of different pastries such as <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebirkes">Tebirkes.</a></p>
